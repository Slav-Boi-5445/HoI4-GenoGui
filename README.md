# HoI4-GenoGui
main steps to use the mod:
1) place files into your \mod folder
2) edit .mod file
3) add to playset

1) to properly install the mod the folder and .mod file must both be placed into your Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod folder
this is generally in the documents folder, for example a full file path
C:\Users\SlavBoi\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod

NOTE THAT YOUR FILE PATH MAY DIFFERE DEPENDING ON INSTALLATION

2) the genocide.mod file must also be editted as it contains the file path as well. 
put the file path of your mod into that folder in the following format:
path="<file path>"
as an example
path="C:/Users/SlavBoi/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/genocide"
note that you must use / slashes not \

3) add the mod to your playlist in the launcher
